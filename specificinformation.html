		<h1> Specific information on the CPU </h1>
	
			<p>
				The cpu (central processing unit) was invented in 1971 and it was intel 4004 released by intel. Federico Faggin invented
				the first commercial cpu. In 1972 Intel released the 8008 processor on April 1 and by 1974 intels better processor the 
				8080 was the standard in the computer industry.

			<h2> History of the CPU </h2>
				<p> 
					Over many years the development of the cpu has advanced a lot including how fast it is and how better it has got and 
					yet the size has changed but yet it all depends on the chipset and generation of cpu you have if its a newer one it 
					will most likely be really good but if its a older cheaper version then not as good but will still get the job done 
					either way. Here are the oldest cpus and when they were released/invented, first is the very first cpu which was 
					invented in 1971 the intel 4004 second is intel 8008 released on April 1, 1972, in 1974 intel released their improved
					and better cpu the 8080 which became the standard in the computer industry next was the intel 8085 processor which was
					introduced in March 1976 and later on that same year intel came out with another cpu the 8086 which came out on June 8
					1976. The very first cpu sold by intel in 1971 was the 4004 but that wasn't the only one they had released. They had a
					lso released the 4001 ROM and 4002 RAM and 4003 shift register. Whereas the 4004 itself performed the calculations the
					other ones were needed to make the processor to function. The max clock speed of the 4004 was 740kHz and the 4004 was
					eventually followed by another processor called the 4040 which was just a bit better than the 4004 it had an extendeda
					instruction and higher performance.
